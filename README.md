CS 362 Final Project - Garduino 

Analysis Project that assists users to help take care of their plants.

To start, you will need to read the final report and look especially at the fritzing diagrams 
and list of things you will need, which includes the other sensors. 

Next, you can dowload the zipped Garduino_DA and _MH files and upload code to arduino once setup is complete.

NOTE: when building set up for Ultrasonic sensor, I measured a distance of 14 cmfrom the ultrasonic sensor 
facing towards the bottom for the cup. you can adjust the distance at your own lesiure as you look throught the Garduino_MH file.
